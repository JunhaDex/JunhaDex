# Hey, I'm Junha Kim <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="30px">

you can call me **Dex**. I'm a front-end developer based in South Korea. I'm a developer who builds through
communication, as I believe software development is not just about writing codeâ€”it's about effective communication with
users, stakeholders, and fellow developers.

My experience is primarily in front-end development, leading teams to build intuitive and large-scale platforms. I am
also capable of full-stack development, with skills in backend server development, cloud infrastructure (AWS/GCP), and
automation.
